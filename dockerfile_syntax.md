### Dockerfile syntax

##### FROM:

The `FROM` instruction initializes a new build stage and sets the `Base Image` for subsequent instructions. As such, a valid `Dockerfile` must start with a `FROM` instruction. The image can be any valid image – it is especially easy to start by **pulling an image** from the Public Repositories.
