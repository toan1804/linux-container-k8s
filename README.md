# Kubernetes Tutorial

### Definition:

- Open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services

- Makes it easy to orchestrate many containers on many hosts, scale them as microservices, and deploy rollouts and rollbacks

- Is a set of APIs to deploy containers on a set of nodes called a cluster

- Divided into a set of primary components that run as the control plane and a set of nodes that run containers

- You can decribe a set of applications and how they should interact with each other and Kubernetes figures how to make that happen 

### Install:

- Install docker-desktop

- You can install kubernetes through docker-desktop

- Or you can use "minikube" for run K8s locally

- Install "kubectl"

*check install successful:*

- ```bash
  docker version
  ```

- ```bash
  minikube version
  kubectl version --output=yaml
  ```

### Initialize a cluster:

```bash
minikube start
```

### Check cluster info:

```bash
kubectl cluster-info
```

### Pod:

> *Pods*Â are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes.

##### Run pod:

```bash
kubectl apply -f hello_pod.yaml
```

##### Get pod:

```bash
kubectl get pod
```

```bash
kubectl describe pod
```

```bash
kubectl logs <port_name>
```

In here, if you ran the file "hello_pod.yaml", port_name will be "nginx", run: `kubectl logs nginx`

##### Enter the command line in pod:

```bash
kubectl exec -it <port_name> -- bash
```

##### Mapping port from pod to external:

```bash
kubectl port-forward <port_name> <external_port>:<pod_port>
```

E.g. `kubectl port-forward nginx 8008:80`

Check it: `curl localhost:8080`

##### Delete resource:

```bash
kubectl delete -f hello_pod.yaml
```
